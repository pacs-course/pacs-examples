# It has been modified so to read some data from environmental variables
# and be compatible with the system of modules used at MOX
#
# YOU CAN change it to suit your need!!!!
#
# Recall that you may also change some options on the fly using
#
#   make target OPTION=MY_OPTION
#
# for instance if you want to change the compiler to clang on the fly
#
# make target CXX=clang++
