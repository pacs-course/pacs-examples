Here you find the examples given in the course

doc -> possible additional documentation

lib -> possible general libraries needed to compile some example

include -> General include files

src -> Directory with the example sources

 ***** INSTALLATION *****

to compile the examples the first operation to be made is to copy the
file Makefile.user to Makefile.inc with

$ cp Makefile.user Makefile.inc

and edit the latter to suit your system.

All Makefiles of the examples include the file Makefile.inc in this
directory and possibly the Makefile.inc file local to the example
under consideration.  You may modify those files to suit your need.

In particular, the user may modify the Makefile.inc to change some
compilation option. The main Makefile.inc also sets the PACS_ROOT
variable, which should indicate the same directory where this README
file is kept (with full path, i.e. the path starts with /).  You may
change it to adapt the compilation process to your local settings by
editing the file (better choice) or by setting an environmental
variable with the same name (put the command export
PACS_ROOT=myExampleDir in the .profile file in your home directory)

Makefile.inc is included in all othe makefiles and it defines and
exports the following make macros:

PACS_ROOT the directory where the Examples resides
CXX the c++ compiler of choice
STANDARD contains the C++ standard used in compilation
MPI_LIBDIR and MPI_INCDIR where to find mpi libraries and header files, respectively
PACS_INC_DIR and PACS_LIB_DIR directory for library and include files related to exercises
DOXYFILE Location of the configuration file for DOxygen used in the exercises
CPPFLAGS Flags for the cpp preprocessor
CXXFLAGS Flags for the c++ compiler
DEPEND the file where dependence is autogenerated
LDFLAGS Flags for the linker
LDLIBS Common libraries (in the form -Ldir -llib)

Note that a local Makefile.inc may be contained (and included) in the
various directories when needed and it may override some of the macros
defined in the common Makefile.inc

I recall that any macro may be overrlued by specifying it when calling make
Example:

make CXXFLAGS+=-DSOMETHING LDFLAGS=SOMETHINGELSE

or by editing the corresponding Makefile (or Makefile.inc if present)

All examples are provided with a Makefile which accepts the following
options (some Makefile may have additional options, reported in the
README file specific for the example)

all -makes the example

clean -as it says

distclean -clean and also deletes temporary file and local doc directory

doc -creates directory doc and fills it with the documentation of the
example produced by doxygen. The file DoxiFileCommon contains the common 
doxygen configuration for all examples

library- makes a library (whenever relevant)

install -installs everithing in PACS_LIB_DIR and PACS_INC_DIR

Being all the first target of (almost all) the makefiles, to compile
the examples is often sufficient to type make. with make doc you
compile the documentation.

                *****   IMPORTANT  ****

To install some utilities used by different examples you must go to
src/Utilities and do

make
make install

in this way a library called libpacs.a (and ist dyanamic equivalent
libpacs.so) is installed in PACS_LIB_DIR and some header files are
installed in PACS_INC_DIR

               ***** WORKING WITH MODULES (but also if you do not use them...)****

If you are using modules, some environmental variables are set by the
module system and will be inherited from the main Makefile.inc (the
one that you have created by copying Makefile.user).  In particular

 mkEigenInc    Where the Eigen libraries (infact the header files) is stored
 mkOpenmpiLib  The directory with the mpi libraries
 mkOpenmpiInc  The directory with the mpi headers
 mkCxxCompiler The c++ compiler of your choice

Other important environment variables set up by the module system that are not 
used un Makefile.user but may be used by other makefiles of the examples are

 mkEigenHome       Where the Eigen files are kept (normally equal to MkEigenInc)
 mkClangSystemBin  The directory holding all clang compiler executables 
 mkCCompiler       The C compiler of your choiche
 mkSuitesparseLib  Directory holding the libraries of the suitesparse suite (umfpack for instance)
 mkSuitesparseInc  Directory holding the header files of the suitesparse suite (umfpack for instance)
 mkCgalLib         Directory with the CGAL libraries (computational geometry libraries)
 mkCgalInc         Directory with the CGAL header files
 mkBoostInc        Directory with the boost libraries     
 mkBoostLib        Directory with the boost header files


So, you have two main choices

1) You use the module system provided with the virtual machine. Then
in your Makefile.inc you have to set only PACS_ROOT, all other
variables are set by the module system.  I recall that if you want to
see all environmental variables set by the modules you may do (all
variables starts with mk)

env | grep mk 

2) You do not use the module system. Then you have again two choices
 
   2.a) You set the various macro in your Makefile.inc (and possibly the other Makefiles, if needed) by yourself

   2.b) You simulate the module environment by creating the environmental variables: you have to put in the .profile file in your home directory the corresponding instructions
        for the bash (the ~/.profile file is read by the bash shell every time you do a login). For example, in my .profile I have

        export mkEigenInc=/usr/local/include/eigen3
        export mkEigenHome=/usr/local/include/eigen3
        export mkOpenmpiLib=
        export mkClangSystemBin=/opt/clang3.7.1/bin
        export mkCCompiler=gcc
        export mkCxxCompiler=/opt/clang3.7.1/bin/clang++
        export mkSuitesparseLib=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
        export mkSuitesparseInc=/usr/include/suitesparse/
        export mkCgalLib=/usr/lib
        export mkCgalInc=/usr/include
        export mkBoostInc=/usr/local/boost_1_57_0/include
        export mkBoostLib=/usr/local/boost_1_57_0/lib

        Remember that after you have modified your .profile file you
        need to do a new login (i.e. open a new shell) for the changes
        to be effective.
