Here you find the examples given in the course

doc -> possible additional documentation

lib -> possible general libraries needed to compile some example

include -> General include files

src -> Directory with example sources

 ***** INSTALLATION *****
in order to compile the examples the first operation to be done is to copy the
file Makefile.user to Makefile.inc with

$ cp Makefile.user Makefile.inc

and edit it to suite your system.

All makefiles include the file Makefile.inc in this directory and
possibly the Makefile.inc file local to the example under
consideration.  You should modify those files to suit your need.

In particular, the user may modify the Makefile.inc to change some
compilation option. The main Makefile.inc also sets the PACS_ROOT
variable, which should indicate this directory (with full path). You
may change it to suite your local installation by editing the file or
by setting an environmental variable with the same name.

Makefile.inc is included in all othe makefiles and it defines and exports the following make macros:

PACS_ROOT the directory where the Examples resides
TRILINOS_LIB_DIR and TRILINOS_INC DIR the directories where TRILINOS resides
TRILINOS_SUFFIX (the suffix that may be used for some the naming scheme)
CXX the c++ compiler of choiche
CC aliases to CXX (for the linker)
STDFLAGS contains the flags used for indicating the C++ standard used in compilation
MPI_LIBDIR and MPI_INCDIR where to find mpi
PACS_INC_DIR and PACS_LIB_DIR directory for library and include files related to exercises
DOXIFILE Location of the configuration file for DOxygen used in the exercises
CPPFLAGS Flags for the cpp preprocessor
CXXFLAGS Flags for the c++ compiler
DEPEND the file where dependence is autogenerate
LDFLAGS FLages for the linker
LDLIBS Common libraries (in the form -Ldir -llib)

A local Makefile.inc may be contained (and included) in the various directories, when needed and may override some of the macros defined in the common Makefile.inc

I recall that any macro may be overrlued by specifying it when calling make
Example 

make CXXFLAGS+=-DSOMETHING LDFLAGS=SOMETHINGELSE



All examples are provided with a Makefile which accepts the following
options (some Makefile may have additional options, reported in the
README file specific for the example)

all -makes the example

clean -as it says

distclean -clean and also deletes temporary file and local doc directory

doc -creates directory doc and fills it with the documentation of the
example produced by doxygen. The file DoxiFileCommon contains the common 
doxygen configuration for all examples

library makes a library (whenever relevant)

install install everithing in PACS_LIB_DIR and PACS_INC_DIR


Being all the first target of the makefile, to compile the examples is
sufficient to type make. with make doc you compile the documentation.

                *****   IMPORTANT  ****
To install some utilities used by different examples you must go to src/Utilities and do
make
make install

in this way a library called libpacs.a (and ist dyanamic equivalent
libpacs.so) is installed in PACS_LIB_DIR and some files are installed in
PACS_INC_DIR
