This is a copy of `git@github.com:lformaggia/astyle_precommit_hook.git`, which is a fork of `mellowcandle/astyle_precommit_hook` adapted for the course on Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing.

Read `README.md` for instructions. `pre-commit` is just a shell script, you may change some options if you wish. The one I am using here are the ones set up in the `apply-astyle` script, also added here.

# Note: you must have astyle properly installed in your system!
