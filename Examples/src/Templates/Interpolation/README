Another example of policy. We want to define a class called interp1D that parform the interpolation of a vector of values given the couble X,Y of interpolation nodes
and values. The type of interpolation is implemented via a policy, that, given X and Y provides the method to interpolate a sincle value at a given location x.

I have implemented Lagrange interpolation, using the classical formula, which interpolates on the polynomial of degree n-1, being n the number of interpolation nodes,
Lagrange interpolation using the Newton formula (which is slightly more stable) and piecewise linear interpolation. 

You can add other interpolatiors, if you wish!
