 * Safely computes the absolute difference of two unsigned.
 *
 * The computation of \f$|a-b|\f$ is troublesome if a and b are of signed type.
 * Indeed if \f$a<b\f$ the result of std::abs(a-b) would be incorrect since
 * the value (a-b) is not representable as an unsigned.
 *
 * This code works only if the arguments are both signed or both unsigned types.
 * Otherwise the situation would be ambiguous since we would perform a
 * comparison between quantities of different type.
 *
 * @tparam T1 the type of the first parameter
 * @tparam T2 The type of the second parameter
 * @param a The first value
 * @param b The second value
 * @return The absolute difference between a and b. The type is equivalent to
 * decltype(a-b);
 * @pre parameters must be both of signed or unsigned type. Parameters must be
 * subtractable. Tested with concepts
