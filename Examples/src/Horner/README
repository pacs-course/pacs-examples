Example on timing. We show the advantage of Horner rule.

We use the utility chrono and the library libpacs.

You should firse enter the directory Examples/src/Utilities and then run

make library
make install

Make sure that Makefile.inc in the root directory is set correctly.

Type
make DEBUG=no 
if you want optimized program
or
make DEBUG=yes or simply make
if you want non-optimized program

Remember: make clean before you recompile with different optimization

Alternatively you may type

make OPTFLAGS='-O3 -ffast-math'

to compile with maximal optimization.

ATTENTION: the code makes use of the chrono utility in libpacs. So you
have first to compile te Utility (go in src/Utility). Secondly, if you
have created libpacs.so the linker will link with the dynamic library

To tell the loader that you need to look in the library directory of
the course, type

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=../../lib

before launching the main program.
