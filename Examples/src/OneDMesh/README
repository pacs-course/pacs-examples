Classes to handle a simple mesh

You need first to compile and install RK45:

go to Examples/src/RK45 and do

make distclean
make dynamic DEBUG=no  (to disable debugging)
make install
make distclean

Include files go to the Examples/include and the library librk45.so in Examples/lib.

Go back to this directory and run make distclean; make dynamic (or static)

Make sure to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly. In 

runTestGenerator.sh you have an example of how to launch the example to test the code

IF YOU WANT TO INSTAL THE CODE (needed for other examples) do

make distclean
make dynamic DEBUG=no  (to disable debugging)
make install
make distclean

This software provides a class to store a simple 1D mesh of a one dimensional domain represented by an interval. It uses a policy, 
that derives from OneDMeshGenerator, to implement the actual mesh generation process. We provide two policies: one for uniform mesh generation, the other that allows to prescribe
a variable mesh spacing. The latter needs to integrate a ordinary differential equation to locate the mesh nodes; to this purpose it uses one of the  runge kutta adaptive schemes
provided in the directory rk45/

main_TestGenerator ia a simple application to test the sofware and run_test_generator.sh is a script that runs the code and lauches gnuplot.
