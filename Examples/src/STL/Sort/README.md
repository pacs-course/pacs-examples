# Sorting tools #

We show the method ``sort()`` with different compirison operators. If
compiled with -std=C++14 or greater we will also use the automatic
lambdas introduced by the C++14 standard.

Note the use of the variable ``__cplusplus`` to get the right code according to the version of the standard.
