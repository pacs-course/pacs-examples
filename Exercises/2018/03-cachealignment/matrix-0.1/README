Exercise on creating a class and library for full matrices

** BUILD **

Use the command

  make libmatrix.a

To build the static libary, or 

  make SHARED_EXT=so libmatrix.so

to build a shared library.
To build the tests use the command

  make tests

To run a set of tests in order to assess the efficiency
of the matrix-matrix product options use the command

  make speedup.pdf

The different implementations of the matrix-matrix
multiplication method can be selected by setting the
following C++ precompiler options

USE_DGEMM   use LAPACK routine DGEMM to implement
            matrix-matrix multiplication

MAKE_TMP_TRANSP
            use built-in implementation of
            matrix-matrix multiplication but 
            transpose the first factor before multiply
            to optimize cache alignment

The Makefile allows to set the following variables for customization:

CXX         C++ compiler command
CXXFLAGS    C++ compiler flags
LIBS        libraries to pass to the linker, e.g. -l<library>
CPPFLAGS    C++ preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
            you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
            nonstandard directory <lib dir>
SHARED_EXT  file extension for shared libraries, e.g. "so"
            on GNU/Linux or "dylib" on OSX


** TESTS **

The following unit tests for the main class methods are provided

test_gauss_seidel  test the iterative gauss-seidel solver method
test_solve         test the direct solver method based on LAPACK
                   subroutine DGESV
test_matrix_mult   test the matrix-matrix multiplication method
                   and output timing info
