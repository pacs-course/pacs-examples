\subsection*{Soluzione}

The proposed solution implements the power method using vectors and metrices
from the \texttt{eigen} library.

The class \cpp{LinearAlgebra\dotsEigenvalues\dotsPower} has one constructor
that takes as parameters the tolerance and the max iteration number. We set
a max iteration number in ordet to avoid an infinite lopp when there is no
convergence. The power method is applied with a call to the \cpp{apply} method,
that requires the matrix and an approximation of the right eigenvector as
input. The code uses this approximation also as seed for the left eigenvector.
The code for the \cpp{Power} class is as follows
%
\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize\sf}
    \lstinputlisting[caption=\cpp{Power} class interface]
    {./src/pagerank-eigen/src/power.hpp}
\lstset{basicstyle=\sf}

Note the two public \cpp{typedef}s at the beginning of the class. They can be
very useful from outside the class,as changing them inside the class updates
automatically all the code. It is interesting to compare the two implementations
for the \cpp{tol| and \cpp{maxit} methods. When there is a \cpp{const} keyword 
at the end of the definition, it means that the method is intended to be just
for access. When there is no \cpp[const} keyword, the method is instead used to
modify the value of the private member. The copy constructor and the assignment
operator have the keyword \cpp{delete}, this means that ithe compiler is now
allowed to instantiate them implicitly. This way of disabling implicit
implementations is only available with \texttt{c++11}. If the new standard is
not available, a common way to avoid implicit instantiations is to declare a
method in the private section of the class and not implement it. this will raise
a compile error if the method is requested somewhere.

\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize\sf}
    \lstinputlisting[caption=\cpp{Power} class implementation]
    {./src/pagerank-eigen/src/power.cpp}
\lstset{basicstyle=\sf}

At the beginning f the \cpp{apply} method it is interesting to note the use of
two different constructors for \texttt{eigen} vectors. In the first and third
case the copy constructor is used, while on the second and forth case we use the
constrcutor that build an empty vector of size \cpp{N}.

The listing for the \cpp{main} program follows
\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize\sf}
    \lstinputlisting[caption=Main program]
    {./src/pagerank-eigen/eig.cpp}
\lstset{basicstyle=\sf}

We note the use of the \cpp{typedef}s that come from the \cpp{PowerMethod}
class. They are accessed from outside the class with their fully specialized
name, with a syntax similar to the one used for namespaces. It is worth noting
that the use of the typedefs do not require the creation of an object of type
\cpp{PowerMethod}, just like the use of static functions and members.
