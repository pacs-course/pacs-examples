EXAMPLES AND EXERCISES FOR PACS COURSE
--------------------------------------
This repo contains source code and descriptions for the examples and exercises
that will be explained during the APSC (Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing) course at
Politecnico di Milano, also known as PACS (Programmazione Avanzata per il Calcolo Scientifico)

The repository contains submodules, so to check it out properly you have to type

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pacs-course/pacs-examples.git
```

or (preferred choice!)

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:pacs-course/pacs-examples.git
```

In the latter case you have to register your ssh keys on a github account.

To keep your local repo update with changes upstream do frequently

```
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

or just, from this directory,

```
./update.sh
```


The software requires a c++ compiler, i.e. gcc >= 8.0 or clang >= 8, and the [Eigen library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for linear algebra
version 8.

You may check the version of you compiler with the option -v. Several examples have now been ported to c++17
and some examples to c++20. Check wether your compile support those standards. You may have a look
on https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support

This directory contains some utilities:

**  load_modules
If you use the module system, typing

```
source load_modules
```
or
```
. load_modules.sh
```

will load the main modules used in the examples, a part `hdf5` which is used only on the example on input-output streams.

## Installing git submodules ## 

If you do not have used --recursive when cloning this repo and you want to use
the git submodules containing third party software type:
```
./install_git_submodules.sh
```

The file submodule_commands.txt contains some reminder of useful git commands for operating with submodules. We also have the following utilities

- `change_submodules_url.sh` changes the protocol of the submodules to https. You should not need it!

- `change_submodules_url_ssh.sh` changes the protocol of the submodules to ssh. You should not need it!

## WHAT DO DO NEXT? ##

- Go to the `Extras/` directory that contains additional software used by some examples and follow the instructions in the local `README.md` file.
- Go to the `Examples/` directory and follow the instructions in the local `README.md` file.
